    "**4.3**. You're given the knowledge ahead of time that there are 3 outliers in the training set data.  The test set data doesn't have any outliers.  You want to remove the 3 outliers in order to get the optimal intercept and slope.  In the case that you're sure of the existence and number (3) of outliers ahead of time, one potential brute force method to outlier detection might be to find the best Linear Regression model on all possible subsets of the training set data with 3 points removed.  Using this method, how many times will you have to calculate the Linear Regression coefficients on the training data?\n",

    "**4.4**  In CS109 we're strong believers that creating heuristic models is a great way to build intuition. In that spirit, construct an approximate algorithm to find the 3 outlier candidates in the training data by taking advantage of the Linear Regression residuals. Place your algorithm in the function `find_outliers_simple`.  It should take the parameters `dataset_x` and `dataset_y` representing your features and response variable values (make sure your response variable is stored as a numpy column vector).  The return value should be a list `outlier_indices` representing the indices of the 3 outliers in the original datasets you passed in.  Remove the outliers that your algorithm identified, use `statsmodels` to create a Linear Regression model on the remaining training set data, and store your model in the variable `OutlierFreeSimpleModel`.\n",

The second plot should include a scatterplot of points from the test set with the same two regression lines fitted on the training set: with and without outliers.

    "**4.7**. One potential problem with the brute force outlier detection approach in 4.3 and the heuristic algorithm you constructed 4.4 is that they assume prior knowledge of the number of outliers.  In general you can't expect to know ahead of time the number of outliers in your dataset.  Alter the algorithm you constructed in 4.4 to create a more general heuristic (i.e. one which doesn't presuppose the number of outliers) for finding outliers in your dataset.  Store your algorithm in the function `find_outliers_general`.  It should take the parameters `dataset_x` and `dataset_y` representing your features and response variable values (make sure your response variable is stored as a numpy column vector).  It can take additional parameters as long as they have default values set.  The return value should be the list `outlier_indices` representing the indices of the outliers in the original datasets you passed in (in the order of 'severity').
